    "The Backpropagation algorithm is a supervised learning method for multilayer feed-forward networks from the field of Artificial Neural Networks.\n",
    "Feed-forward neural networks are inspired by the information processing of one or more neural cells, called a neuron. A neuron accepts input signals via its dendrites, which pass the electrical signal down to the cell body. The axon carries the signal out to synapses, which are the connections of a cell’s axon to other cell’s dendrites.<br>\n",
    "The principle of the backpropagation approach is to model a given function by modifying internal weightings of input signals to produce an expected output signal. The system is trained using a supervised learning method, where the error between the system’s output and a known expected output is presented to the system and used to modify its internal state.<br>\n",
    "Technically, the backpropagation algorithm is a method for training the weights in a multilayer feed-forward neural network. As such, it requires a network structure to be defined of one or more layers where one layer is fully connected to the next layer. A standard network structure is one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer.<br>\n",
    "Backpropagation can be used for both classification and regression problems, but we will focus on classification in this tutorial.<br>\n",
    "In classification problems, best results are achieved when the network has one neuron in the output layer for each class value. For example, a 2-class or binary classification problem with the class values of A and B. These expected outputs would have to be transformed into binary vectors with one column for each class value. Such as \\[1,0\\] and \\[0,1\\] for A and B respectively. This is called a one hot encoding."
